# Clustering-of-stocks
Clustering a stock portfolio for the diversification problem

# Objectives
The goal of this work is: to cluster stocks using unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as
KMeans and Aglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. Stock clustering can be useful for a variety of financial
and investment purposes:

# Portfolio Diversification

Diversification helps reduce risks due to the fact that the investor doesn't invest money in any one asset, but collects a portfolio of many different assets that have little relationship with each other. Then, even if one of the investorâ€™s securities falls in price, others are likely to rise - and the profitability on them will eventually cover the losses that have arisen.

# Risk and Return Analysis

Understanding which stocks are clustered together can help investors assess the expected level of risk and return for each cluster. This can be useful for making decisions about how to allocate capital in a portfolio.

# Trend Forecasting

Clustering can identify stocks that exhibit similar behavior in the market. This can help investors identify trends and make decisions based on expected market movements.

# Financial Market Analysis

Clustering can serve as a tool for analyzing the structure of the financial market, identifying groups of stocks with common characteristics.
